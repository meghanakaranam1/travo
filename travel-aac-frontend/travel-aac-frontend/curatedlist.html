      <p class="pbox">
        Bunjee jumping involves jumping from a great height with our ankles tied to an elastic
        rope. This adventure is filled with adrenaline pump- which is dreamt by most men an women.
        The jump is taken from any tall building, clif, helicopter, hot air balloon. This adventure
        is not recommended for acrophobics. When the person jumps, the cord gets extended after its
        full length has been reached and the elastic nature pulls it back and causes a to and fro motion.
        if you suffer from a heart condition, epilepsy, high blood pressure, diabetes, or a 
        neurological disorder, or are pregnant, it is advised that you don’t attempt the jump.

      <p class="pbox">
        The thrill of flying in the sky gives a great adrenaline rush and a chance to see the landscape below from a bird’s eye view. It is a simple act unlike other flying adventure activities and involves a powered paraglider, which is formed by an engine, a propeller within a cage and an integrated seat harness. All these are mounted on a trike with wheels. The most exclusively used para-motors feature two-stroke types small engines, which run on oil and mixed gasoline. The thrust that is generated by the engine is controlled by the pilot with a hand-held throttle while the paraglider is manoeuvred for turns with inputs on lines called brake-lines attached to the trailing edge of the paraglider wing.

          <p class="pbox">
            Skiing is a means of transport using skis to glide on snow. Variations of purpose include basic transport, a recreational activity, or a competitive winter sport. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS). Skiing has a history of almost five millennia. Although modern skiing has evolved from beginnings in Scandinavia, it may have been practiced more than 100 centuries ago in what is now China, according to an interpretation of ancient paintings. However, this continues to be debated.

          Trekking is an outdoor activity of walking for more than a day. It is a form of walking, undertaken with the specific purpose of exploring and enjoying the scenery. Trekking is more challenging than hiking since it tests one's ability, endurance and their mental as well as psychological capacity. There are many different ways to do a trek and trekking culture often varies from country to country. It usually takes place on trails in areas of relatively unspoiled wilderness.

        <p class="pbox">
          River rafting is similar to the river running done in a drift boat except you use an inflatable raft instead of a boat. River rafting is sometimes called whitewater rafting because it involved riding rapids. River rafting involves rapid riding; using a raft to navigate through rapids on a river. Although most river rafting is experienced in a modern inflatable raft traditionally this type of activity was done with a wooden raft, though more out of necessity than choice.

        <p class="pbox">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools. Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board.

        Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. Knowledge of proper climbing techniques and the use of specialized climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes. Because of the wide range and variety of rock formations around the world, rock climbing has been separated into several different styles and sub-disciplines, such as scrambling, another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, differentiated by rock climbing's sustained use of hands to support the climber's weight as well as to provide balance.
