        <h2>What to see in Hyderabad?</h2>
        <div id="h">
            <p><b>Hyderabad,</b> is a city with two distinct faces. The old one with stories from the past, an age where royalty was the way of life and then there’s the new city, Secunderabad with its bright shiny buildings and a promise to pave a way into the future. The first sight to greet us at the Kachiguda station was the old stone building of the station, albeit with fresh paint. Three days of exploring an old city started off with impatience.</p>
